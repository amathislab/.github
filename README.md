## Welcome to the A. Mathis Group at EPFL! 

Broadly speaking, we work at the intersection of computational neuroscience and machine learning. Ultimately, we are interested in reverse engineering the algorithms of the brain, in order to figure out how the brain works and to build better artificial intelligence systems.  

Check out our [website for more information](http://www.mathisgroup.org), and see our open source code below!

Of particular interest:

- [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut): for animal pose estimation

Code for research papers:

- [DMAP: a Distributed Morphological Attention Policy for Learning to Locomote with a Changing Body](https://github.com/amathislab/dmap): Code for Chiappa et al. NeurIPS 2022
- [DeepDraw](https://github.com/amathislab/DeepDraw): for modeling proprioception
